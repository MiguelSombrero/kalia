# Quality backlog

Findings from periodic `/quality-sweep` runs land here, grouped only by
severity — **MUST** / **SHOULD** / **COULD** (MoSCoW), never by sweep
date. A sweep is opened as its own PR and reviewed like any other change;
who may start one, and when, is in CLAUDE.md "Quality checks". Each
finding gets a permanent ID within
its category (`MUST-1`, `SHOULD-1`, ...) that is never reused, even after
the finding is resolved or lifted — retired IDs move to the "Retired"
section below rather than being deleted, so a later sweep never
double-lists an already-known issue and a later ID never collides with an
earlier one. Every finding carries a *(confirmed &lt;date&gt;)* — the most
recent sweep that independently reconfirmed it; a sweep that rediscovers
an existing finding updates that date (and the description, if details
changed) in place instead of adding a duplicate entry. An entry not
mentioned by a given sweep simply keeps its prior confirmed date — that
isn't staleness needing action, just "not independently re-verified this
time."

A `**[needs decision]**` tag means the finding needs product-owner input
before it's a well-scoped task; anything untagged is ready to implement as
written.

**Lifting a finding into an iteration.** The product owner reviews the
backlog and tells an AI agent which findings to promote — by ID (`MUST-1`,
`SHOULD-3`, ...), a range, or a one-off description for anything not yet
listed here. A `[needs decision]` finding is resolved in that conversation
before it is written up as a task, never silently guessed at. The lifted
task keeps a backreference to its origin (e.g. "(Quality backlog
SHOULD-3)") so the history survives leaving this file — IDs are permanent,
so the ID alone is enough without a date. In the same PR that adds the
task, the finding moves to "Retired" below noting where it went, rather
than being deleted: deleting it would let a later sweep reissue its ID for
an unrelated finding.

*The findings below predate this format (adopted 2026-07-28) and were
carried over from the last two dated sweeps (2026-07-23, 2026-07-27) under
fresh, undated IDs, with each entry's original sweep date kept as its
initial confirmed-date. Findings already retired before this format existed
keep their original sweep-dated labels in "Retired" below, unchanged, since
they're already cross-referenced from merged PRs and
`docs/tasks/iteration-4.md`.*

## MUST

*(none currently open)*

## SHOULD

*(none currently open)*

## COULD

*(none currently open)*

## Retired

Permanent, append-only record of resolved or lifted findings — kept so IDs
are never reused and history isn't lost once a finding leaves the live
lists above. Findings retired before this format existed (2026-07-28) keep
their original sweep-dated labels (e.g. `2026-07-23 SHOULD-1`); findings
retired from 2026-07-28 onward use the undated label straight from the
live section they came from.

- ~~2026-07-23 COULD-4~~ (LIKE-wildcard metacharacters unescaped) — superseded by 2026-07-27 SHOULD-2 (same finding, with a concrete repro), itself lifted below.
- ~~2026-07-23 COULD-8~~ (docker-compose backend healthcheck was a bare port-open probe) — resolved: now polls `/actuator/health`.
- ~~2026-07-27 MUST-1~~ (README status banner said iteration 3 was next) — resolved by PR #82.
- ~~2026-07-23 SHOULD-1~~ (hardcoded dev Postgres password, no warning) — lifted into `docs/tasks/iteration-4.md` task 7.
- ~~2026-07-23 SHOULD-6~~ (stale architecture.md banner + Keycloak version duplication) — lifted into iteration-4 task 5.
- ~~2026-07-27 SHOULD-2~~ (unescaped LIKE wildcards, with repro) — lifted into iteration-4 task 7.
- ~~2026-07-27 SHOULD-3~~ (no fixture proves ArchUnit/Modulith rules catch a violation) — lifted into iteration-4 task 6.
- ~~SHOULD-3~~ (V001 pre-creating `cart`/`ordering`/`payment` schemas biased the undecided store-model choice toward the own-store outcome) — decided 2026-08-08: the store left the vision, ADR-0004 and ADR-0005 are deprecated, and the schemas are dropped by [iteration-5 task 07](iteration-5/07-drop-store-schemas.md). The finding was right about the direction of the bias and understated it — those schemas were the only physical trace the store ever had.
- ~~2026-07-27 SHOULD-4~~ (module guard against a protected module landing before auth) — lifted into iteration-4 task 6.
- ~~2026-07-27 MUST-2~~ (react-i18next "not yet wired" stale claim) — lifted into iteration-4 task 5.
- ~~2026-07-27 COULD-10~~ (Redis/Valkey §8 wording) — lifted into iteration-4 task 5.
- ~~2026-07-27 COULD-11~~ (stale SearchFilters client-component example) — lifted into iteration-4 task 5.
- ~~MUST-1~~ (`app/api/*` route handlers described as an already-built BFF proxy layer when none existed) — resolved by iteration-4 task 2: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` is now a real `app/api/*` route handler, and `docs/architecture.md` §5/§6 updated to describe what actually exists.
- ~~SHOULD-7~~ (backend runtime image's five `.trivyignore` waivers, all from Pebble in the Ubuntu 26.04 base, expire 2026-08-26) — lifted into [iteration-5 task 08](iteration-5/08-clear-backend-image-trivy-waivers.md). Its `[needs decision]` — `25-jre-noble` versus `26-jre` — was resolved by the product owner on 2026-08-08 in favour of `25-jre-noble` before the task was written, and is a constraint there rather than an open question.
- ~~MUST-2~~ (`docs/architecture.md` §5 claimed one route handler when a second, intentionally unauthenticated one exists) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~SHOULD-1~~ (catalog search: leading-wildcard name search and non-functional style/country indexes) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 04](iteration-5.5/04-catalog-search-usable-indexes.md).
- ~~SHOULD-2~~ (`searchBeers` has no direct unit test) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 05](iteration-5.5/05-catalog-search-test-gaps.md).
- ~~SHOULD-4~~ (`backend/README.md` fully restates the logging conventions ADR-0013 says it should only summarize) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~SHOULD-5~~ (Iteration DoD gate restated near-verbatim in `docs/roadmap.md` and CLAUDE.md) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~SHOULD-6~~ (`backend/README.md` bounded-parameters bullet carries unlinked multi-line "why" rationale) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md). Confirmed 2026-08-23: this finding's Lombok half is already resolved (that bullet is now one line); only the bounded-parameters half survived into the task.
- ~~SHOULD-8~~ (concurrent first-ever sign-in can create two user records for one Keycloak subject) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 03](iteration-5.5/03-fix-concurrent-first-sign-in-race.md).
- ~~SHOULD-9~~ (ADR-0016's CSP `unsafe-inline` revisit trigger fired and nothing revisited it) — `[needs decision]` resolved by the product owner on 2026-08-23: re-affirm `'unsafe-inline'` rather than adopt nonce-based CSP or SRI. Lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 02](iteration-5.5/02-amend-csp-unsafe-inline-adr.md).
- ~~SHOULD-10~~ (removing a cellar entry's last bottle leaves a zero-bottle row behind forever) — **not** lifted into iteration 5.5: confirmed 2026-08-23 that [iteration-6 task 06](iteration-6/06-entry-with-no-bottles.md), already drafted, covers this more thoroughly and correctly ties it to that iteration's public-cellar-read work. Superseded by that task rather than duplicated.
- ~~SHOULD-11~~ (task 01's `cellar/web` checkbox was ticked before the package existed) — resolved: confirmed 2026-08-23 that `backend/src/main/java/fi/kalia/cellar/web/` now exists (created by iteration-5 task 02's implementation), so the checked criterion is now true. No task needed.
- ~~COULD-1~~ (orval version duplicated and drifted between `README.md`, ADR-0012 and `package.json`) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md). Confirmed 2026-08-23: the drift widened further (README/package.json now at 8.24, ADR-0012 still 8.22.0).
- ~~COULD-2~~ (WCAG 2.1 AA enforcement described in three places) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~COULD-3~~ (DDD-lite package structure restated in three places) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~COULD-4~~ (`listBreweries()` unpaginated, loads and sorts the full table) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 07](iteration-5.5/07-catalog-api-hardening.md).
- ~~COULD-5~~ (`LocaleSwitcher` uses an unvalidated `as Locale` assertion) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 09](iteration-5.5/09-validate-locale-switcher-input.md).
- ~~COULD-6~~ (`CatalogApiIT` has no sort-by-`style` test) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 05](iteration-5.5/05-catalog-search-test-gaps.md).
- ~~COULD-7~~ (`CatalogController` constructs the domain-layer `BeerSearchCriteria` directly) — `[needs decision]` resolved by the product owner on 2026-08-23: fix now, together with COULD-11, rather than defer. Lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 06](iteration-5.5/06-catalog-module-edge-layering.md).
- ~~COULD-8~~ (`sort` query parameter accepts and silently truncates trailing garbage) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 07](iteration-5.5/07-catalog-api-hardening.md).
- ~~COULD-9~~ (springdoc production-exposure default untested) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 08](iteration-5.5/08-pin-springdoc-exposure-default.md).
- ~~COULD-10~~ (`docs/architecture.md`'s hand-maintained module diagram has no drift detection) — `[needs decision]` resolved by the product owner on 2026-08-23: generate-and-assert in a test, keeping the hand-written mermaid diagram as the document readers see. Lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 10](iteration-5.5/10-detect-module-diagram-drift.md).
- ~~COULD-11~~ (`CatalogApi` injects the domain-layer `BeerRepository` directly into the module's public API) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 06](iteration-5.5/06-catalog-module-edge-layering.md), together with COULD-7.
- ~~COULD-12~~ (`docker-compose.yml`'s backend port comment still says the API is unauthenticated) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~COULD-13~~ (`docs/tasks/backlog.md` defers a logging item on a reason that stopped being true in iteration 3) — lifted into [iteration-5.5 task 01](iteration-5.5/01-documentation-accuracy-sweep.md).
- ~~COULD-14~~ (task 02 pointed at a "task 01 question 6" that no longer exists) — resolved: confirmed 2026-08-23 that the dangling reference has already been reworded away in a later PR. No task needed.
- ~~COULD-15~~ (`Entry.addBottles` had no upper bound on bulk-add quantity) — resolved: confirmed 2026-08-23 that `AddBottleRequestDto` already bounds `quantity` with `@Min(1)`/`@Max(24)`. No task needed.
